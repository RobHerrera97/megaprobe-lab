Bio
=====

My name is Roberto J. Herrera, a biology major/ math minor from the University of Puerto Rico at Cayey. I am really interested in the field in bioinformatics, I hope this project will allow me to gain skills outside my comfort zone. Outside of science, I enjoy watching and analyzing sports particularly baseball and basketball.
